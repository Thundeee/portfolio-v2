# Course Assignment

## Goal
To create your portfolio website.

## Brief
As you are coming to the end of your studies and are looking at options in the workplace, it is important to create a portfolio website of work you have done. Over the course of Industry Knowledge, you will be working on this portfolio website and will submit it for grading as your CA. 

## Level 1 Process

1. Consider the target audience and their likely personas.
1. Research other portfolio websites for ideas.
1. Choose what you want to highlight for your portfolio. Is your portfolio programming-focused or design-focused?
1. Decide on the content architecture for the site. How many pages should it have and which projects should make up the portfolio?
1. Create a wireframe for the site.
1. Create an Figma prototype of the website.
1. The process you follow for the development of your site is up to you. The site should be mobile responsive and display work you have done.

## Delivery
A link to the Figma prototype.
A link to the finished portfolio website.
A link to the public, well formed GitHub repo.
