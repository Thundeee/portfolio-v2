     <h3>Unite Bot</h3>
<p>
  Unite Bot is a Discord bot I made as a passion project. The bot is made in JavaScript and uses the Discord.js library. The bot has a lot of fun commands and is still in development and not released yet.
  This project was made to learn new technologies and to have fun. There is a bunch of exciting things going on in this project so if you're only going to check out one of my projects, this is the one!

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>
  Workflow was a school assignement where we were tasked to work as a QA Engineer and implement tests for developers. I implemented auto formatting, linting, unit tests and end-to-end tests to the existing project, creating a CI/CD pipeline.
The Project used Github Pages for hosting and had to pass all tests before being deployed.
